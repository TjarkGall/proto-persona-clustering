# k-proto Clustering of Personas to Adapt Synthetic Populations to Future Scenarios

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

The presented clustering approach creates proto-personas based on census and mobility survey data for the Île-de-France region. This method aims to facilitate the combined work of designers and simulation experts, considering future uncertainties of urban mobility systems. A scientific article with a detailed method description is currently being published.

## Features

- Cluster proto-personas based on census and mobility survey data
- Integrate trends and uncertainties for different future scenarios
- Scale up populations to match set target values via Iterative Proportional Updating


## 1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/urban-mobility-decision-support-tool.git
```

## 2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data and Scenarios

The method relies on input data for the current population, mobility behaviour, and scenarios. It is filled with data from Île-de-France, but you can replicate the process with data from other contexts.
